# PomodoroTechnique

# Reason for a Pomodoro App

This app was made as part of the MoureDev's (by Brais Moure) community Monthly Challenge (April 22'). Repository can be found here: https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022

# Foundations

Pomodoro technique is a time management method that asks one to alternate pomodoros — focused work sessions — with frequent short breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental fatigue (being "Pomodoro" the italian word for "tomato" -yeah that explains the design!!!)

1) Pick a task
2) Set a 25 minutes timer
3) Work on the task until the time is up
4) Take a 5 minutes break
5) Every four ponodoros (por cycles), take a longer break (in this case, the long break is set to 20 minutes.

# Features

The App uses Views
Tabbed activity using two fragments
Custom Views and animations using Canvas objects
Recycler View list and custom adapters
Database SQLite for saving the tasks
Coroutines to write to and read from databases
Notifications

Known issues:
For some limitations in my designing skills, the app is block to portrait mode screen

Future improvements:
Soon I'll get the app available in Spanish, since it's my mother language
I'll implement a short tour when the app is launched for the first time

# Let's have a look!
